# SoundClassification
Sound classification continues to take more and more place in our lives day by day. Algorithms that classify sounds work in the background of many products we use in our daily lives. Examples of these are virtual assistants, text-to-speech applications, smart home security systems (Environmental Sound Classification). It has a wide range of uses, from Speech recognition to Classifying Song Genre. The more machine learning algorithms with high accuracy rates are developed in different areas, the easier our lives will be in the future.

Here, I will share with you 3 different machine learning models that I developed for a product. This product can classify 6 different cat sounds and tell you what your cat is doing even when you are not with your cat.
